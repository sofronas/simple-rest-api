### Flask RESTful API Example

This is a simple example of a RESTful API built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. The API allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.

#### Prerequisites

Before running the Flask application, make sure you have Python and Flask installed on your system. You can install Flask using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask
Save to grepper
Getting Started
Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to Directory: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Flask application files.

Run the Flask App: Run the Flask application using the following command:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will start the Flask development server, and the API will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000 by default.

API Endpoints
GET /tasks: Retrieve all tasks.
GET /tasks/<task_id>: Retrieve a single task by its ID.
POST /tasks: Create a new task.
PUT /tasks/<task_id>: Update an existing task.
DELETE /tasks/<task_id>: Delete a task by its ID.
Sample Data
The API uses in-memory sample data for demonstration purposes. If you want to retrieve data from a database, you need to create functions to interact with the database. This typically involves connecting to the database, reading data, and organizing it into appropriate data structures.

Usage Notes
When sending a POST request to create a new task, ensure that the request body includes a title field. The description field is optional.
For PUT and DELETE requests, specify the task ID in the endpoint URL (/tasks/<task_id>).
This example is for educational purposes and uses an in-memory data structure. In a real-world scenario, you would typically use a database to store and manage your data.
